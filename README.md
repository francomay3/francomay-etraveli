## Comment

I think the code is not difficult to read, but just in case I added comments here and there to explain
what is going on in the code.

## Thank You

Finally, I want to thank the people on Etraveli that saw potential in me and gave me the opportunity to
show my skills. I would really love to have the priviledge of working side by side with you and with a
great team of developers.
