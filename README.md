# Franco May - "Star Wars" Assignment for Etraveli

## Tools Used
* React
* Redux
* Materialize CSS

## Comment

My components are in the "Components" folder inside "src". "Body" and "Header" are the two main components
and inside "Body" there is "Movies" and "MovieData".

I think the code is not difficult to read, but just in case I added comments here and there to explain
what is going on in the code.


## Thank You

I want to thank the people on Etraveli that saw potential in me and gave me the opportunity to
show my skills. I would really love to have the priviledge of working side by side with you and with a
great team of developers.
